dotfiles
========

See http://dotfiles.github.io/

Ideal: Run `./start` from a shell to bootstrap a new machine with symlinked dotfiles and loads of homebrew.

More Likely: Step through `./start` line-by-line, updating things that are outdated.

Opt-in to language-specific configurations via `./start-${LANG}`.
